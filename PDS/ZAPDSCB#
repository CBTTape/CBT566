)F FUNCTION -

     To change DSCB attributes for a dataset in fullscreen mode.

)X SYNTAX  -

     ZAPDSCB Ýdataset.name¨


)O OPERANDS -
))dataset.name

    The dataset name should either be in quotes, to get it
    exactly as is, or it will be prefixed.

    >>>>  THE PREFIX WILL NOT BE WHAT YOU THINK.  <<<<

    The prefix comes (in this program) from the ACEE userid,
    and NOT from the TSO prefix, as indicated by the PROFILE
    TSO command.

    In other words, if the dataset.name is unquoted, the
    resulting dataset which is operated upon, will be:

         ACEEUSRI.dataset.name

    So to accurately specify the dataset name and be sure of
    it, please enclose it in quotes.
