      The DUMP**** members of this pds were fixed
            to use PUTLINE output under TSO
 ------------------------------------------------------
This note concerns the DUMP**** programs here, to dump the
contents of control blocks, so you can easily see what you
have in them.  Most of them have been modified to use PUTLINE
output, so that you can trap their output and scroll up and
down.

Programs called DUMP**** which were NOT fixed are:
DUMPPPT and DUMPPRB.  I think the rest of them were fixed.

Old versions of the DUMP**** programs end with the letter O,
in their member names.

To facilitate trapping the output of these commands, I have
included in this pds, some trapping execs, which were mostly
written by Mark Zelden.  Their names are:

TSOB - Trap and ISPF Browse the output.
TSOE - Trap and ISPF Edit the output.
TSOV - Trap and ISPF View the output.
TSOR - Trap and TSO REVIEW the output.  (REVIEW source
        (modules beginning with REV****) is on CBT File 134.
        REVIEW load modules are on CBT File 135.  Don't forget
        to copy all their aliases.  REVIEW is a TSO browser
        that can work either in TSO READY mode, or under
        TSO ISPF).

If you want to assemble the old versions of the DUMP****
programs that were not fixed for PUTLINE, then use members
ending with the letter "O" and -----

   rename the member PRTDUMPT back to PRTDUMP before
   assembling.

Good Luck.     Sam Golob - March 2017
