I have added a new utility call WLMREXX.

It reads the WLM PDS and creates SAS code to build a SAS database
with the data from the WLM PDS.  It does not have any hard coded
names except the WLM PDS name and the SAS output dataset.  It
gets the member names via the ISPF LM function and then reads the
data via the ISPF TB functions.

Now all we need is someone to write the SAS reports for it.

Here is my Zipped, tso xmitted file for my source to be put on
the CBT site.
