Hi Sam,

I have updated the console/spy once again.

Internally I have called it SPY since that is what my users are
used to.

I have fixed some bugs in this release.

I am now authorized only when I need to be.

I use STORAGE OBTAIN and STORAGE RELEASE and with BNDRY=PAGE now.

I fixed the AXRES, AXFRE, AXSET, and AREXT to always free the
AXLIST if an AXRES has been done.

I found something interesting here.

If you call it CONS, have it APF authorized in IKJTSO00 and in a
LNKLIST library and do not use the 'special svc' and use it under
ISPF, then at logoff time it gets an ABEND S378.  Weird!  Changed
it to SPY and it works fine!

Hi Sam,



I found a major bug in the code when switching screen sizes.  It
locks up the session.



Here is a new copy.

I checked auto-update and it works.

I tested it on a TSO as mod-2, mod-3, mod-4, mod-5, in ISPF and READY.

Sorry for extra work on updating this again so soon.

Thanks again,

Sam Bass

Hi Sam,

   OK.  I got it done.  Please check File 566 on Updates on
   www.cbttape.org.  Thanks for your good work.  A lot of people
   can use it.

   Nice talking to you today.

   All the best......

Hi Sam,

I installed some new PC consoles via the OS/Console support in
the z/9** series.

I make all of my consoles 3278-5E, so my old SPY program dies
miserably.

I downloaded CBT025, program=CONS390 and went to work on it.

It supports 'any' console model even odd stuff like 54x132.

Here is my working copy, although I don't think the AUTOUPDATE
works.

My current CBTTAPE stuff is on file=566

Can you add this program to it?

 <<console.xmi>>  <<console.asm>>
